# Current-Mirrors
A current mirror is a basic analog circuit used to copy (or "mirror") a current from one branch of a circuit to another. In this repository discusses the design of various current mirror topologies including Basic Current Mirror, Cascode Current Mirror, Wide Swing Current Mirror etc.
## Key Specificationsâ€‹
Key specifications for a current mirror focus on how accurately and reliably it replicates a reference current. Here are the most important ones:
- Current Transfer Accuracy
- Output Resistance (R<sub>out</sub>)
- Voltage Compliance
- Accuracy & Process Independence
- Temperature Dependence
- Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR)
